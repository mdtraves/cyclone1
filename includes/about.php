        <p class="about-us-p text-center">We aim to make your booking in process as simple as
            possible. Once you have decided which of our classes is most convenient for you
            (see the find a
            club page) simply give us a call or message us, its
            that simple.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="about-us-p text-center">A class generally consists of a brief stretch and warm up followed by thin air or partner based routines, pad-work and kick shield combinations, practice of our grading syllabus, a strength or cardio burnout and a cool down.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="about-us-p text-center">We will never force you to take part in sparring or contact work, this element of our training is entirely optional! If you do wish to compete we will give you a safe and controlled environment in which to do so.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="about-us-p text-center">When you first attend simply wear loose comfortable clothing, we recommend tracksuit bottoms and a t-shirt and to train bare. Donâ€™t forget a drink.</p>
